# Responsive design practice

In this exercise we want to create a responsive layout which will adjust depending on whether it is viewed on mobile, table or desktop width screen size.

You can see the expected end result at [http://constuctorlabs-rwd.herokuapp.com/](http://constuctorlabs-rwd.herokuapp.com/). Try adjusting the width of the window to see how the layout changes at different breakpoints.

Also, in the bottom right corner of the example you have a `toggle overlay` button that will overlay a 12 column grid on top to help you figure out the proportions of columns in the layout in relation to each other.

## Instructions

1. Fork repo
2. Clone forked repo to local machine
3. Use flexbox to make the layout responsive and adjust for different screen widths. You may need add other CSS properties to get your page to look right.
4. Follow the mobile-first strategy and create the default layout for mobile devices.
5. Once that mobile layout is working, use media queries to create a layout for tablet and then desktop. The media queries have have already been set up for you.
6. Once finished, commit your work, push to github and create a pull request.
